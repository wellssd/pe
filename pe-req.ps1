# pe-req.ps1 - Request privilege escalation
#
# Detail - Using a Syncro task tray option, a user choose a privilege escalation request which will create a Syncro 
#          alert and give the user a popup notification indicating the request has been submitted.  Syncro automated
#          remediation will then close the alert and run pe.ps1 on the asset which will determine the logged in users,
#          add that user to the local Administrators group, create a ticket and notify the user that the request has
#          been completed.  The ticket will be used to track privegele escalation requests as well as remove user from
#          local Administrators group after the end of the business day.
